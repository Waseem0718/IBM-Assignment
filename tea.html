    <p> Tea leaves pictures can be used for the prediction of various tea leaves diseases which causes huge loss<br/> in agricultural system every year. The proposed system - Tea leaves Image Processing System helps us to the analysis <br/>of leaves and thereby help us in predicting various leaves diseases. The input to the proposed system is the Tea leaves<br/> Image. The leaves portion is segmented and leaves color, shape and texture features are extracted and taken together<br/> to form a feature vector and then analysis of leaves are done which is used for the diagnosis of various tea leaves<br/> diseases. This proposed system will help the farmers in the early diagnosis of diseases.
